## How to Generate Images Using ChatGPT

### Step 1: Access ChatGPT with Image Generation

- Go to [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
- Ensure you have GPT-4 with vision or DALL-E 3 access
- Or use the DALL-E 3 web interface directly at [labs.openai.com](https://labs.openai.com)

### Step 2: Copy Prompt

- Copy one of the prompts above
- Paste it into ChatGPT or DALL-E 3

### Step 3: Request Size Specification

- After the prompt, add: **"Generate this image at exactly 1400x700px"** (or appropriate size for gallery/member images)
- For member images: **"Square aspect ratio 600x600px"**
- For gallery images: **"4:3 aspect ratio 800x600px"**

### Step 4: Generate & Download

- Click "Generate" and wait for the images
- Download each image
- Rename according to the file naming scheme (e.g., `hero.jpg`, `rohit.jpg`, etc.)

### Step 5: Organize Files

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p public/images/our-team/members
mkdir -p public/images/our-team/gallery

# Move files to respective directories:
# - hero.jpg → public/images/our-team/
# - rohit.jpg, anna.jpg, etc. → public/images/our-team/members/
# - competition-1.jpg, workshop-1.jpg, etc. → public/images/our-team/gallery/
```

### Step 6: Compress (Optional but Recommended)

Use an image compression tool to optimize file sizes:

- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) — Online JPEG/PNG compression
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) — Google's image optimizer
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com) — Mac desktop app

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific:** The prompts are detailed for a reason—DALL-E 3 responds better to specific descriptions
2. **Request Multiple:** Generate 2-3 variants of each image and choose the best
3. **Consistent Style:** All prompts emphasize "professional," "high-quality," and "4K appearance" for visual consistency
4. **Refine if Needed:** If an image doesn't match, add details like:
   - "More diverse team" or "Add females" if representation is off
   - "Brighter lighting" or "Darker background" for mood adjustments
   - "More equipment visible" or "Less crowded" for composition
5. **Check Aspect Ratios:** Ensure downloaded images match required dimensions before saving
